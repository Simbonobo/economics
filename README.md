# Seminar Statistics and Econometrics 2021/22

This project provides an implementation of a Support Vector Machine on an [U.S. stock market data set from 2014-2018 from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018).

The original data used as well as the cleaned version can be found in the [data](data) directory.

## Setup

I recommend to setup a virtual environment or conda environment with python version 3.9 and using the provided requirements.txt to install all necessary packages.
